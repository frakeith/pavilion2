# Example Tests

This directory contains example tests written for Pavilion, targetting a generic Linux based
cluster. They can fairly easily modified to handle different MPI layers and compilers. 

## Tutorials

This directory contains tests meant to be used as part of the Pavilion test writing tutorial. 

## Pre-Packaged

These tests are meant to run (mostly) out of the box. They demonstrate basic Pavilion features
and provide a starting point for writing your own tests.
