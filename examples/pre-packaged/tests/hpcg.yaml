      This tests the computational capability of all nodes. Failures can be caused
      by:
      Build Failures:
        - Only builds with a single compiler/MPI combination, so it narrows down
          the products that could be causing the error.
      Run Failures:
        - MPI errors could be an issue with the product installation.  Consult the
          product manager.
        - MPI errors could be an HSN fabric issue.
        - Errors could indicate a single bad node.
      If other failures are encountered, be sure to take notes of the form of the
      failure and the fix to be merged into this file.
