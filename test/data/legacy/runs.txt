# This is a list (and directory) of legacy pavilion test runs
# They are kept to ensure compatibility between test run objects
# of older versions of Pavilion.

# This should be a newline separated list of legacy test runs to put into the 
# working directory, where Pav legacy unit tests will load them.
# - They should contain a 'build_dir' directory with their build
# - All softlinks should be made relative.
# - I think that's it.
